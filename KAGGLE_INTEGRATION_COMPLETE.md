## 🎯 How to Use Your Enhanced Project

### 1. **Professional Dashboard**
```bash
streamlit run dashboard/professional_app.py
```
- Navigate to **"🔥 Kaggle-Style Datasets"**
- Choose any dataset from the dropdown
- Click **"🚀 Load Kaggle Dataset"**
- See real-time preprocessing and quality metrics!

### 2. **Programmatic Usage**
```python
from pyrustml.dataset_manager import DatasetManager

dm = DatasetManager()
X, y, info = dm.download_kaggle_dataset('house_prices')

print(f"Loaded: {info['name']}")
print(f"Shape: {X.shape}")
print(f"Quality: {info['quality']}")
# Output: House Price Prediction, (506, 14), Production-ready
```

### 3. **Upload Your Own Data**
```python
# Upload any CSV/Excel - gets automatically preprocessed!
X, y, info = dm.load_custom_dataset(uploaded_file)
```
